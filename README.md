# SwiTap

My "first" Android game.

(The first one was actually the sister app QuickTap, but it only processed tapping.)

It's a game about swiping and tapping.

In single player:

It is a primitive game, but can be thought of as "Temple Run" without graphics.

In multiplayer:

It is like a dance off, but with your fingers.
